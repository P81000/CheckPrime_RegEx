# Prime Number Verification using Regular Expressions

This repository contains simple code examples in different programming languages to verify if a number is prime using regular expressions. The repository includes files in the following languages:

1. `RegEx_prime_number.py` - Python implementation.
2. `RegEx_prime_number.js` - JavaScript implementation.
3. `RegExPrimeNumber.java` - Java implementation.
4. `RegEx_prime_number.c` - C implementation.

Each file contains an implementation that uses regular expressions to perform prime number verification.

Please refer to the individual source files for the code implementations.

Feel free to explore the source code in each file to understand how prime number verification is done using regular expressions in each programming language.

We hope this repository proves to be useful to you!
